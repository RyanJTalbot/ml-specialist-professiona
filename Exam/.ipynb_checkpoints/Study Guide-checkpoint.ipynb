    "<b>Benefits</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Data labeling provides users, teams and companies with greater context, quality and usability. More specifically, you can expect:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- More Precise Predictions: Accurate data labeling ensures better quality assurance within machine learning algorithms, allowing the model to train and yield the expected output. Otherwise, as the old saying goes, “garbage in, garbage out.” Properly labeled data  provide the “ground truth” (i.e., how labels reflect “real world” scenarios) for testing and iterating subsequent models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Better Data Usability: Data labeling can also improve usability of data variables within a model. For example, you might reclassify a categorical variable as a binary variable to make it more consumable for a model.  Aggregating data in this way can optimize the model by reducing the number of model variables or enable the inclusion of control variables. Whether you’re using data to build computer vision models (i.e. putting bounding boxes around objects) or NLP models (i.e. classifying text for social sentiment), utilizing high-quality data is a top priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Challenges</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Data labeling is not without its challenges. In particular, some of the most common challenges are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expensive and time-consuming: While data labeling is critical for machine learning models, it can be costly from both a resource and time perspective. If a business takes a more automated approach, engineering teams will still need to set up data pipelines prior to data processing, and manual labeling will almost always be expensive and time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prone to Human-Error: These labeling approaches are also subject to human-error (e.g. coding errors, manual entry errors), which can decrease the quality of data. This, in turn, leads to inaccurate data processing and modeling. Quality assurance checks are essential to maintaining data quality.\n"

    "### 2.1.2.2. Explain data labeling approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Data labeling is a critical step in developing a high-performance ML model. Though labeling appears simple, it’s not always easy to implement. As a result, companies must consider multiple factors and methods to determine the best approach to labeling. Since each data labeling method has its pros and cons, a detailed assessment of task complexity, as well as the size, scope and duration of the project is advised.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Here are some paths to labeling your data:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Internal labeling - Using in-house data science experts simplifies tracking, provides greater accuracy, and increases quality. However, this approach typically requires more time and favors large companies with extensive resources.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "- Synthetic labeling - This approach generates new project data from pre-existing datasets, which enhances data quality and time efficiency. However, synthetic labeling requires extensive computing power, which can increase pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Programmatic labeling - This automated data labeling process uses scripts to reduce time consumption and the need for human annotation. However, the possibility of technical problems requires HITL to remain a part of the quality assurance (QA) process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outsourcing - This can be an optimal choice for high-level temporary projects, but developing and managing a freelance-oriented workflow can also be time-consuming. Though freelancing platforms provide comprehensive candidate information to ease the vetting process, hiring managed data labeling teams provides pre-vetted staff and pre-built data labeling tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Crowdsourcing - This approach is quicker and more cost-effective due to its micro-tasking capability and web-based distribution. However, worker quality, QA, and project management vary across crowdsourcing platforms. One of the most famous examples of crowdsourced data labeling is Recaptcha. This project was two-fold in that it controlled for bots while simultaneously improving data annotation of images. For example, a Recaptcha prompt would ask a user to identify all the photos containing a car to prove that they were human, and then this program could check itself based on the results of other users. The input of from these users provided a database of labels for an array of images.\n",
